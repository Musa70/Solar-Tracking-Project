# Solar-Tracking-Project
This project focuses of different deep learning-based algorithms to enhance solar tracking

The demand for clean and sustainable energy has increased the popularity of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels. PV solar panels are the most effective technology for transforming the sun's rays into a valuable energy source. To maximize the amount of energy captured, the rays of light from the sun must be at a 90-degree angle to the surface of the PV panel. To accomplish this, PV panels are modified with solar trackers that can effectively track the sun's position as it shifts during the day. Due to the randomness and nonlinearity of metrological data, using deep learning (DL) algorithms to enhance solar trackers has gained much popularity among researchers. However, given the varying nature of metrological data, single DL models sometimes fail to perform satisfactorily. For this purpose, this project aims to enhance solar tracking using various deep-learning techniques which were motivated by the working in (Phiri et al., 2023).
