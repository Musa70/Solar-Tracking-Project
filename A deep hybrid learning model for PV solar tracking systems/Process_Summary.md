The methodology used to develop a hybrid hour-ahead solar tracking DL framework that comprises the SCT, CNN, and LSTM modules is detailed in this section. The approach used was partitioned into four steps. The first step involved various stages such as dataset description, pre-processing, feature transformation, and data splitting. The second step was the development and training of the DHL model, which involved training the model on the available dataset. In the third step, the model was tested and assessed on whether further optimization was required. Finally, in the fourth step, the model output results were recorded and evaluated based on the appropriate performance metrics. Further, the experiments conducted were implemented using the Python 3.9-based Keras framework with Tensorflow (Géron, 2019). The program was run using a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) on Google Collaboratory (Bisong, 2019). Additionally, The effectiveness of the SCT-CNN-LSTM framework used in this study was verified against the other DL models, including the CNN, GRU and LSTM.
